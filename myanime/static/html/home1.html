                Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and
                most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture
                and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change
                throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed
                the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece.
                It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of
                Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an
                unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the
                pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King. Enter Monkey
                Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of
                a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened,
                toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for
                being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting
                adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately,
                the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his
                childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line,
                experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and
                battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted
                of all fortunes—One Piece......

                Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, for intense training
                following events which fueled his desire to be stronger. Now
                Akatsuki, the mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is
                closing in on their grand plan which may threaten the safety of
                the entire shinobi world. Although Naruto is older and sinister
                events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in
                personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far
                more confident and possesses an even greater determination to
                protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will
                carry on with the fight for what is important to him, even at

                A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided
                they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a
                notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the
                shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would
                use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm. High school

                and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly

                Asta and Yuno were abandoned at the same church on the same day.
                Raised together as children, they came to know of the "Wizard
                King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and
                promised that they would compete against each other for the

                magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by
                training physically. When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is

                Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by
                monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to
                hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these
                giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is
                not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure.
                To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living
                within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years
                without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is
                soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the
                supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for
                survival against the man-eating abominations. After witnessing a
                horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures,
                Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting
                into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the
                merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based

                follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and

                against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them

                The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather
                unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood
                dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of
                his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so
                much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact,
                all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to
                an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill
                of battling and has become quite bored. This all changes with
                the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be
                Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos
                proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to
                become certified heroes that will be recognized for their
                positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no
                one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story
                of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric
                individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully
                give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll
                become popular in the process. ....

                Five years after the events of Dragon Ball, martial arts expert
                Goku is now a grown man married to his wife Chi-Chi, with a
                four-year old son named Gohan. While attending a reunion on
                Turtle Island with his old friends Master Roshi, Krillin, Bulma
                and others, the festivities are interrupted when a humanoid
                alien named Raditz not only reveals the truth behind Gokuu's
                past, but kidnaps Gohan as well. With Raditz displaying power
                beyond anything Goku has seen before, he is forced to team up
                with his old nemesis, Piccolo, in order to rescue his son. But
                when Goku and Piccolo reveal the secret of the seven mystical
                wish-granting Dragon Balls to Raditz, he informs the duo that
                there is more of his race, the Saiyans, and they won’t pass up
                an opportunity to seize the power of the Dragon Balls for
                themselves. These events begin the saga of Dragon Ball Kai, a
                story that finds Goku and his friends and family constantly
                defending the galaxy from increasingly more powerful threats.
                Bizarre, comical, heartwarming and threatening characters come
                together in a series of battles that push the powers and
                abilities of Goku and his friends beyond anything they have ever

                After five years of harboring unspoken feelings, high-schooler
                Taiju Ooki is finally ready to confess his love to Yuzuriha
                Ogawa. Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding
                green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the
                world—turning every single human into stone. Several millennia
                later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely
                nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity
                stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters
                one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who
                has been active for a few months. Taiju learns that Senkuu has
                developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of
                civilization with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains
                combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover
                a method to revive those petrified. However, Senkuu's master
                plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those
                who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's
                petrification remains unknown.......
